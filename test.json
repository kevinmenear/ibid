At least two surfac of the nanofibril can have silk-lik protein attach through specif h-bond ; the rest of the protein is globular . the protein matrix stiffen through dehydr control by the introduct of hydrophob phenol . crustacea add up to 40 % calcium salt . the stiff of cuticl can rang from ten of gpa to 1 kpa .
