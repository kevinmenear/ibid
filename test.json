A mechanist model on secondari dispers by wind predict that seed trait could have an effect on the probabl of seed movement by influenc the \u2018 wind intercept paramet \u2019 and threshold lift-off veloc ( schurr et al . 2005 ) . the wind intercept paramet refer to the dimensionless ratio between wind veloc experi by the seed and wind veloc at refer height . If the thick of the seed , as it lay on the ground , fall below a threshold aerodynam rough length , thi paramet will becom 0 result in no movement of the seed . the threshold lift-off veloc is determin by balanc between wind drag and friction between the seed and the ground surfac .
